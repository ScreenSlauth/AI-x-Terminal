To use a voice, try: { "tool": "speak", "args": ["Hello world", 1.0, "Microsoft David Desktop"] }

Response: It seems like you want to use the `speak` tool! However, the correct format is JSON, so I'll help you with that.

To use the `speak` tool, you can respond in this format:
```
{ "tool": "speak", "args": ["text to speak", "voice name(optional)"] }
```
For example, if you want the assistant to speak "Hello, world!" in the default voice, you can respond:
```
{ "tool": "speak", "args": ["Hello, world!"] }
```
If you want to specify a voice, you can use the `getVoices` tool first to get a list of available voices, and then use the voice name as the second argument. For example:
```
{ "tool": "speak", "args": ["Hello, world!", "slt_kevin"] }
```
Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

Response: I'm happy to help! I can assist you with a variety of tasks. Here are some examples of what I can do:

* Get the current time: I can tell you the current time using the `getTime` tool.
* Perform arithmetic operations: You can use the `add` tool to add numbers, or the `calculate` tool to perform more complex calculations.
* Manipulate text: I can `echo` back text, `reverse` text, or `countWords` in a piece of text.
* Work with files: You can use the `readTextFile` tool to read the contents of a text file, or the `writeTextFile` tool to write to a text file.
* Interact with the web: I can `fetchURL` to retrieve the contents of a webpage, or `webSearch` to search the internet for a specific topic.
* Convert text to speech: You can use the `speak` tool to convert text to speech, and even list available voices using the `getVoices` tool.
* Format dates: I can use the `formatDate` tool to format dates in a specific way.

These are just a few examples, but I can do much more! If you have a specific task in mind, feel free to ask me and I'll do my best to help.

Here's an example of how you can use one of my tools:
`{ "tool": "getTime" }`

Just let me know what you need help with!
